                                        <dt><b>SECP1513 (TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION SYSTEM )</b></dt>
										<p>The Technology Information System course has broadened my perspective on how technology integrates into organizations to optimize processes and decision-making. I gained insights into topics like database management, networking, and the role of information systems in business strategy. This course has inspired me to think critically about how data can be leveraged for innovation and efficiency, aligning with my career aspirations in data engineering. It also highlighted the importance of staying updated with emerging technologies to remain relevant in the field.</p>
										
										<dt><b>SECI1013 (DISCRETE STRUCTURE)</b></dt>
										<dd>
											<p>The Discrete Structure course has been instrumental in developing my problem-solving and analytical thinking skills. By exploring topics like set theory, logic, graph theory, and combinatorics, I have gained a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations that underpin computer science. These concepts have improved my ability to approach complex problems systematically, which is vital for programming and algorithm design. The course also challenged me to think abstractly and reason rigorously, both of which are essential for a successful career in data engineering.</p>
										</dd>
										<dt><b>SECR1013 (DIGITAL LOGIC)</b></dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Studying Digital Logic has provided me with a solid understanding of the basic building blocks of computer systems. Through topics like logic gates, flip-flops, and circuit design, I have learned how hardware and software work together to execute instructions. This knowledge bridges the gap between abstract programming and physical hardware, allowing me to appreciate the intricacies of computer architecture. Designing and analyzing circuits has also enhanced my logical thinking and attention to detail.</p>
										</dd>
                                        <dt><b>SECJ1013 (PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUE)</b></dt>
										<dd>
											<p>The Programming Technique course has been a cornerstone of my computer science education. It introduced me to programming fundamentals, including syntax, logic, and problem-solving using structured programming languages. Writing, debugging, and optimizing code have been valuable exercises in honing my technical and creative skills. This course not only strengthened my ability to think algorithmically but also instilled the discipline of writing clean, efficient, and maintainable codeâ€”a vital trait for any programmer.</p>
										</dd>
                                        <dt><b>ULRS1032 (KURSUS INTEGRITI DAN RASUAH)</b></dt>
										<dd>
											<p> ULRS1032 emphasized the importance of ethics and values in both academic and professional settings. It was a reflective journey that encouraged me to examine my principles and decision-making processes. Through discussions on honesty, accountability, and leadership, I learned how integrity fosters trust and respect in collaborative environments. This course reminded me of the significance of ethical behavior in technology, particularly in ensuring data privacy and avoiding bias in algorithms, which is crucial for my future role in data engineering.</p>
