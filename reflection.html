                                        <dt><b>SECP1513 (TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION SYSTEM )</b></dt>
					<dd>	
						<p>The Technology Information System course has broadened my perspective on how technology integrates into individual's life to optimize processes and decision-making. I gained insights into topics like database management, and the role of information systems in business strategy. This course has inspired me to think critically about how implementation of technology in daily life system works for innovation and efficiency. It also highlighted the importance of staying updated with emerging technologies to remain relevant in the field.</p>
					</dd>					
					<dt><b>SECI1013 (DISCRETE STRUCTURE)</b></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Discrete Structure course has been helping me in developing my problem-solving and analytical thinking skills. By learning topics like set theory, logic, graph theory, and combinations, I gained a deeper understanding of the mathematical functions that aligns with computer science. These concepts have improved my ability to solve complex problems systematically, which is crucial for programming and algorithm design. The course also challenged me to think analatically and critically, both of which are essential for a strong fundamental in data engineering.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt><b>SECR1013 (DIGITAL LOGIC)</b></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Studying Digital Logic has provided me with an understanding of the basic components of computer systems. Through topics like logic gates, flip-flops, and circuit design, I learned how hardware and software work together to execute instructions. This knowledge helps to understand the correlation between programming and physical hardware, allowing me to get insights of the computer architecture. Designing and analyzing circuits has enhanced my logical thinking and detail while working with a problem.</p>
					</dd>
                                        <dt><b>SECJ1013 (PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUE)</b></dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The Programming Technique course has been a crucial for my computer science education. It introduced me to programming fundamentals, including syntax, logic, and problem-solving using structured programming languages. Writing and debugging code have been essential in sharpening my technical and creative skills. This course not only strengthened my ability to think algorithmically but also taught the needs of writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code which is a vital step for any programmer.</p>
					</dd>
                                        <dt><b>ULRS1032 (KURSUS INTEGRITI DAN RASUAH)</b></dt>
					<dd>
						<p> ULRS1032 emphasized the importance of ethics and values in both academic and professional settings. It encouraged me to examine my principles and decision-making processes. Through discussions on honesty, accountability, and leadership, I learned how integrity develops trust and respect in an environments. This course reminded me of the importance of ethical behavior in technology, specifically in ensuring data privacy , which is crucial for role in the field of computer science.</p>
